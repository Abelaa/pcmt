In order to make the bundle reuasble I tested out several configuration and packaging options.
These are initial experiments with extendable and package that can be configured on the fly.

As Symfony Recommends, I created a config file inside the bundle itself.
All the options configurable by the end user are inside Extension class.
As it doesn't matter where the config is placed as long as it's placed under bundle root configuration key (pcmt_attribute in this case)
I will place all attribute config under pcmt_attributes.yml

As a result, all congfiguration will be available in $configs array in PcmtConnectorBundle class

1/ We will provide configuration class called 'DataDownloadPathProvider' which will return set of valid directories/or directory that the user
may want to save their data to.
This class will have default value but can be totally overriden by library user.
